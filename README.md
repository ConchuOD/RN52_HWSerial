This is a beta version of a hardware serial based library for the RN52.      
It is intended for use with a Teensy as the only hardware serial on (most) arduinos is the one shared with USB, plus due to being based on Teensy's hardware serial will not compile for a non kinetis board.                       

I have successfully used the serial3 portion of the code to make a bluetooth speaker. The remainder of the library is just copy pasted from the that channel.
