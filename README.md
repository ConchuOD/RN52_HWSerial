This is an alpha version of a hardware serial based library for the RN52.
It is intended for use with a Teensy as the only hardware serial on (most) arduinos is the one shared with USB.
For now this code is untested as I am waiting on a breakout board for my RN52 & was written on a computer without even a c compiler.
Once the post office locates my breakout boards I will test the functions in this library.
